## Usage Instructions

1. **Navigate to your Mission Control directory:**
   ```bash
   cd "Mission control"
   ```

2. **Run each command in sequence** - wait for each to complete before running the next

3. **After each command**, review the generated code and make any necessary adjustments

4. **Install any additional dependencies** that might be suggested

5. **Test each component** as it's created to ensure proper integration

6. **Integrate with your existing Mission Control app** by updating the main navigation

## Integration with Existing App

After generating all components, add the release management to your main navigation in `src/App.tsx`:

```typescript
// Add to your navigation items
{
  id: 'releases',
  label: 'Release Management',
  icon: <Rocket className="w-5 h-5" />,
  component: <ReleaseManagementApp />
}
```

## Expected Outcome

After completing all commands, you'll have:
- Complete release management system
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Fully functional React components
- Mock data and services for testing
- Analytics and reporting capabilities
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility compliance
- Test suite and documentation

The system will be ready for integration with your existing Mission Control application and can be extended with real API integrations as needed.
