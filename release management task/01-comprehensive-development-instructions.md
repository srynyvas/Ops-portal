- Multi-environment deployment tracking
- Release timeline and milestone management
- Feature and bug tracking within releases
- Approval workflows and gates
- Rollback and hotfix management
- Release notes and changelog generation
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Risk assessment and deployment readiness checks

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Real-time updates and notifications
- Role-based access control
- Audit trail and compliance tracking
- Performance metrics and analytics
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

### Step 2: Design System Architecture
Design the system with these core modules:

**Data Layer:**
- Release entities (Release, Feature, Task, Deployment)
- User and team management
- Environment configuration
- Approval workflows
- Audit logs

**Service Layer:**
