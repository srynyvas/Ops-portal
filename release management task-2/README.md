- **Task Nodes** (Leaves): Small, detailed, individual work items

**Interactive Features**:
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Intuitive reorganization of work items
- **Expandable Structure**: Collapse/expand branches for focus
- **Real-time Editing**: Inline editing with live collaboration
- **Rich Properties**: Detailed metadata for each node
- **Visual Connections**: SVG lines showing relationships and dependencies

**Enterprise Capabilities**:
- **Multi-user Collaboration**: Real-time editing with conflict resolution
- **Advanced Analytics**: Burndown charts, velocity tracking, bottleneck analysis
- **Integration Ready**: Git, CI/CD, project management, and communication tools
- **Mobile Optimized**: Touch-first design with gesture support
- **AI-Powered**: Intelligent suggestions and automated insights

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Analyze Existing Implementation
```bash
# First, study the current mindmap structure
cd "Mission control"
head -100 "../UI/release-management-tool.tsx"
```

**Key patterns to understand:**
- Hierarchical node structure with drag-and-drop
- SVG-based connection rendering
- Complex state management for editing and collaboration
- Visual customization with colors, icons, and themes

### Step 2: Set Up Enhanced Environment
```bash
# Install mindmap-specific dependencies
npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable recharts immer framer-motion d3-hierarchy
```

### Step 3: Execute Commands in Sequence
```bash
# Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
claude create src/types/mindmap-release-management.ts
claude create src/components/releases/MindmapCanvas.tsx
claude create src/components/releases/EnhancedMindmapNode.tsx

# Phase 2: Management (Week 2)
claude create src/components/releases/AdvancedReleaseCatalogue.tsx
claude create src/components/releases/PropertyManager.tsx
claude create src/components/releases/AdvancedDragDrop.tsx

# Continue with remaining phases...
```

## üåü Why Choose the Mindmap Approach?

**Visual Clarity**: Complex release structures become immediately understandable through hierarchical visualization, reducing cognitive load and improving planning accuracy.

**Intuitive Interaction**: Drag-and-drop manipulation feels natural and responsive, enabling rapid reorganization and iteration during planning sessions.

**Collaborative Planning**: Real-time editing allows teams to collaborate seamlessly, whether in the same room or distributed globally.

**Scalable Complexity**: The mindmap structure gracefully handles simple releases with a few features or complex enterprise releases with hundreds of interconnected components.

**Data-Driven Insights**: Rich analytics provide actionable intelligence while maintaining the visual context that makes mindmaps so powerful for planning.
